# Order number is the order that you can upgrade between OSes in the game
# Order also acts as an ID.
# Requirements for OSes and other parts are stored based off their IDs.

# Name is simply a name used for displaying it to the user
# Date available is the date you are able to upgrade to this CPU.
# Description is also just to display to the user.
# Clock_Mhz, measured in MHz.
# Lithography, measured in nm.
# Cores, amount of cores
# Threads, amount of threads (typically double the amount of cores if the CPU supports multi-threading).
# L1Cache, the L1 cache. Measured in KB.
# L2Cache, the L2 cache. Measured in KB.
# L3Cache, the L3 cache. Measured in KB.
# TDP, the CPU's power consumption, measured in watts.
# Architecture: 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, may add more in the future (such as ARM64)
