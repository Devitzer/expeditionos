# Very easy, just an array of different RAM sizes measured in KB.
# Order is ID, it's the order that the RAM will be offered upgrades for.
# Capacity, The RAM capacity, measured in KB.
# Technology, the type of technology the ram uses, Example: DDR4
# CPUReq, the minimum CPU needed (based off ID) needed to allow the upgrade to the RAM.
# OSReq, the minimum OS needed (based off ID) needed to allow the upgrade to the RAM.
